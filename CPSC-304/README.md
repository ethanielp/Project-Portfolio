A project to build a database application from start to finish

Worked with 2 other students

*Goals as adapted from project specificaion:* 
- Deciding on an application for which a database system would be required 
- Modelling the domain of the application, and defining the application functionalities 
- Designing and implementing the schema 
- Populating the database (but this should not be the main focus of the project) 
- Writing  the  code  needed  to  embed  the  database  system  in  an  application  that  has  a  Graphical User Interface (GUI).
